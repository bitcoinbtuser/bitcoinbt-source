# Distribution Plan

## Overview

BitcoinBT (BTCBT) activates independent consensus rules
at block height 903,845.

A one-time special allocation of 630,000 BTCBT
is issued at block height 903,850.

This allocation is defined directly in consensus rules
and enforced at the protocol level.

This document clarifies the structure,
purpose, and transparency model of that allocation.

- Special subsidy issuance height: 903,850
- Issuance type: consensus-defined one-time allocation

network sustainability and ecosystem development.

Intended categories include:

- Core protocol development

## Custody and Transparency

The special allocation:

- Exists on-chain
- Is publicly traceable
- Can be independently verified by full nodes
- Is visible through block explorers

There are no hidden wallets or off-chain issuance systems.

If multisignature custody is used,
the structure will be publicly documented.

---

## Release Policy

Funds may be released gradually
based on operational and development requirements.

There is no recurring or automated allocation beyond the initial issuance.

No administrative override exists to increase supply.

---

## Relationship to Ongoing Block Rewards

After fork activation at 903,845:

- Standard block subsidy rules apply
- Halving interval: 210,000 blocks

does not alter the long-term deterministic issuance schedule.

- Secondary consensus-controlled inflation

All issuance logic is publicly verifiable.

---

## Supply Integrity

Total supply growth is controlled exclusively by:

- Deterministic halving intervals

Full nodes independently verify every block subsidy.
