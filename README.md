## Status

BitcoinBT is currently in a **public testing phase**.

- The network is live and mining is active
- External testers and developers are welcome
- All code contributions must be submitted via Pull Requests
- Consensus-related changes are reviewed conservatively

**Test Infrastructure**
- Explorer: https://bitcoinbt.xyz
- Stratum (test): stratum+tcp://bitcoinbt.xyz:3333

## What is BitcoinBT?

**BitcoinBT (BTCBT)** is a full-node implementation derived from **Bitcoin Core v26**.

The chain is designed as a **Bitcoin hard fork**, inheriting the complete Bitcoin blockchain history up to **block height 903,844** (July 3, 2025).  
From **block 903,845 onward**, BitcoinBT applies its own consensus rules.

BitcoinBT does **not** replace Bitcoin and does **not** interact with the Bitcoin main network.

**Important Notes**
- Bitcoin holders do **not** automatically receive BTCBT
- BTCBT is mined independently after the fork point

---

## Consensus Design

- Proof-of-Work: **SHA-256d**
- UTXO-based model
- Compatible with existing mining pools, explorers, and wallet infrastructure

---

## Key Features

- ⏱ **5-minute block intervals**
- 📦 **Adaptive Block Size** (4 MB ~ 32 MB)
- 🔐 **Taproot + Schnorr + MuSig2**
- ⚡ **SegWit enabled / Lightning-compatible design**
- 📉 **ASERT Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm**
- 🧱 **No experimental consensus features**
  - No CashTokens
  - No AI-based mechanisms
  - No non-standard opcode forks

---

## Special Block Reward (Block 903,845)

At the fork activation point (**block 903,845**), BitcoinBT includes a **one-time special block reward of 2,000,000 BTCBT**.

This reward is:

- Generated by **mining**, not pre-issued
- Created as part of the **first BitcoinBT coinbase block**
- Not derived from Bitcoin balances, snapshots, or airdrops
- Fully visible and verifiable on-chain

This reward exists to ensure **long-term operational viability** of the BitcoinBT network.

---

## Rationale for the Special Reward

Launching and maintaining a global Proof-of-Work blockchain requires **substantial and continuous resources** beyond block production alone.

The special reward is intended to support the following real-world requirements:

### 🏛 Foundation & Governance Operations
- Legal structuring across jurisdictions
- Compliance reviews and legal opinions
- Accounting, custody, and operational administration
- Ongoing protocol stewardship

### 🧑‍💻 Core Development & Engineering
- Long-term Bitcoin Core–level maintenance
- Consensus upgrades and security hardening
- Wallet, RPC, and node software improvements
- Developer incentives and external contributor grants

### 🛠 Infrastructure & Network Reliability
- Public explorers and indexing services
- Seed nodes and global full-node infrastructure
- Continuous testing environments
- Monitoring, alerting, and incident response

### 📈 Exchange Listings & Liquidity
- Technical integration with exchanges
- Listing, security review, and maintenance costs
- Liquidity provisioning and market stabilization
- Ongoing exchange-side support

### 🌍 Ecosystem Growth & Outreach
- Documentation and developer resources
- Miner onboarding and pool integration
- Community support and education
- Global communication and adoption efforts

These activities represent **multi-year commitments**, not one-time expenses.

The special block reward is designed to align the long-term sustainability of BitcoinBT with transparent, on-chain issuance rather than ad-hoc funding models.

## Development Process

The `main` branch is the active development branch.

- Direct pushes to `main` are disabled
- All changes are submitted via Pull Requests
- At least one review is required before merging
- Consensus-related changes are evaluated conservatively

See:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines
- `/doc` — technical documentation

---

## Testing

BitcoinBT follows standard Bitcoin Core build and test workflows.

Example:
```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
